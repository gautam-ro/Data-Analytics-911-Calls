# Data-Analytics-911-Calls\

## Data Loading & Exploration:

Imported the 911 emergency call dataset using pandas.

Performed initial exploration with .info(), .head(), and basic descriptive stats to understand the structure and size of the dataset.

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Identified key columns such as time stamps, location, title of emergency, and zip codes.

Converted time columns into appropriate datetime objects for time-series analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed trends such as the most common emergency types (Fire, EMS, Traffic).

Visualized top ZIP codes and townships for call frequency using bar plots and count plots.

Examined call distribution by day of the week and month to uncover patterns.

Created heatmaps to show call volume by hour and day, helping understand peak hours for emergencies.

## Insights & Visualization:

Used Seaborn and Matplotlib for rich, insightful visuals (bar graphs, heatmaps, line charts).

Created pivot tables and groupings to summarize patterns by time and location.

Plotted emergency trends over time for different categories using time-series graphs.
